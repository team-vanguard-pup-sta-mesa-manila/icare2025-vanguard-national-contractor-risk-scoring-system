# **National Contractor Risk Scoring System**

## Overview

The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), the principal government agency responsible for steering the Philippines' infrastructure development, occupies a position of profound fiscal and ethical vulnerability. While its function is crucial to economic progress, national connectivity, and disaster resilience, the ongoing issues within the DPWH are not isolated operational deficiencies but rather manifestations of a deep-seated infrastructure-corruption cycle rooted in historical precedent, systemic loopholes, and influential political capture. <br>

This structural pathology enables two primary forms of harm to the public purse and safety. Firstly, market distortion and monopoly flourish. Instead of genuine competitive equilibrium, a small, favored network of contractors, often utilizing opaque or related corporate entities to circumvent regulations, engages in bid-rigging and strategic "contract rotation." This systematic collusion suppresses fair pricing, resulting in inflated project costs and the commissioning of substandard work. Secondly, this systemic failure directly compromises quality, frequently resulting in "ghost projects" or structures built with dangerously weak materials. This negligence culminates in catastrophic failures, turning critical public works into public hazards during natural disasters and necessitating repeated, costly repairs that deplete national resources. <br>

The persistence of these chronic issues is not due to a lack of existing procurement law, but rather a profound failure of effective, integrated enforcement. Critical performance data, such as CPES evaluations and COA audit findings, remain stored in segregated, often non-machine-readable systems. This pervasive lack of data interoperability prevents comprehensive, real-time risk assessment, thereby enabling high-risk actors to operate with impunity. The analytical foundation for reform successfully moves beyond anecdotal evidence by establishing quantitative outcome variables (e.g., Infrastructure Risk, tied to factors like asset age and maintenance recommendations) and linking them directly to verifiable measures of governance failure (e.g., Contractor Financial Integrity and the spatial manifestation of Monopoly and Administrative Discretion). This empirical correlation validates the necessity of the proposed intervention. <br>

The overriding rationale for implementing the National Contractor Risk Scoring System (NCRSS) is the strategic imperative to transform this endemic failure of public procurement into a verifiable system of integrity and performance assurance. The current reactive governance model has proven incapable of safeguarding public funds and ensuring quality infrastructure. Therefore, the NCRSS is conceptualized as a necessary and targeted administrative countermeasure. It is designed to resolve the crisis by introducing objective, data-driven checks that critically limit subjective administrative discretion, enforce radical transparency through Beneficial Ownership standards, and systematically detect and deter the market manipulation that facilitates monopoly and recurrent contractor failure. The NCRSS thus represents a fundamental and urgent shift toward building an infrastructure of accountability in the Philippines. <br>

## **Policy Overview**

The effective execution of the national infrastructure agenda in the Philippines is fundamentally compromised by inherent weaknesses in public procurement governance. These systemic failures facilitate corrupt practices, allow monopoly through market distortion, and introduce excessive administrative discretion, ultimately leading to project failure, fiscal leakage, and diminished public trust. Specifically, the current system lacks a consolidated, objective, and predictive mechanism to assess contractor risk, relying on fragmented data and delayed sanctions that allow disqualified or opaque entities to evade accountability and repeatedly win contracts. The National Contractor Risk Scoring System is designed to address these  critical vulnerabilities. This policy is aimed at establishing a data-driven barrier to ensure public funds are entrusted only to demonstrably qualified and transparent contractors.

The National Contractor Risk Scoring System is a unified, automated platform that integrates existing procurement and performance data and assigns each contractor a standardized risk score. This score enables agencies to identify high-risk contractors before awarding projects, reduce discretion, and enhances transparency.

#### *Smart Checks, Safe Choices*

1. Data Integration and Consolidation <br>
The NCRSS integrates contractor-related data from existing government systems into a centralized program. These include CPES performance ratings, PhilGEPS registration and beneficial ownership disclosures, GPBB Blacklisting Database, DPWH project progress records, and COA audit findings. The integration resolves the long-standing issue of scattered datasets and provides government agencies with a unified, real-time reference for contractor evaluation.

2. Automated Contractor Risk Scoring <br>
The system generates a standardized risk score for each contractor based on quantifiable indicators such as past delays, cost overruns, contract amendments, substandard performance evaluations, COA red flags, and patterns of political or geographic contractor dominance. Scores are expressed within a fixed scale and grouped into risk categories (Low, Moderate, High, Critical), enabling agencies to objectively compare the performance and integrity of contractors across sectors and regions.

3. Pre-Award Risk Alerts and Decision Support <br>
Before a procuring entity awards a contract, the NCRSS issues a pre-award risk alert corresponding to the contractor’s risk category. Low- and Moderate-risk scores allow procurement to proceed normally, while High-risk scores require written justification and additional due diligence. Critical-risk scores trigger mandatory review or temporary withholding of award. This process guides procurement officers toward evidence-based decisions and limits the influence of personal discretion or political pressure.

4. Public Transparency Portal <br>
To promote transparency and citizen oversight, the NCRSS includes a public-facing dashboard that presents simplified contractor profiles, performance histories, and risk classifications. The portal enables civil society, journalists, and the general public to track contractor reliability and monitor patterns of procurement behavior. By opening performance information to scrutiny, the system reinforces accountability and reduces opportunities for hidden arrangements.

5. Preventive Anti-Corruption Measures
The NCRSS functions as an early-warning mechanism by identifying high-risk contractors before project implementation. By reducing reliance on manual assessments and standardizing evaluations across agencies, the system minimizes the potential for favoritism, opaque decision-making, or manipulation of procurement outcomes. Its automated scoring system also creates a digital trail for all procurement decisions, strengthening traceability and discouraging corrupt practices.

## **Methodolgy**

This study applied a risk-driven data forensics approach to assess systemic weaknesses in public procurement and to determine the operational requirements for the National Contractor Risk Scoring System (NCRSS). The methodology focused on standardizing heterogeneous government datasets, generating objective risk measures, and conducting quantitative tests that isolate structural performance and integrity issues.

#### *Data Sources*

The analysis used the following data sets provided: <br>
Data 1: Infrastructure Data <br>
Data 2: Sumbong sa Pangulo - Flood Control <br>
Data 3: COMELEC's Fiscal and Electoral Data from July 2025 <br>

#### *Analytical Framework*

The research followed a three-pillar Risk-Driven Data Forensics Framework:

1. Feature Engineering and Metric Development <br>
The first phase standardized raw data into measurable risk indicators. Categorical and numerical fields were reformulated into four core NCRSS components—Quality, Performance, Integrity, and Network. <br>
   a. Condition data were converted into ordinal risk scores. <br>
   b. Timeliness variables were transformed into schedule variance metrics. <br>
   c. Cost deviations were computed as overrun ratios. <br>
   d. Contractor linkages were mapped to network concentration indicators. <br>

| Metric | Formulation | CIR Score Component |
|---|---|---|
| Condition Risk Score | Mapped: 'Low' to 1, 'Moderate' to 2, 'High' to 3, 'Critical' to 4 | Quality (Q): Direct input for Asset Quality Tracking. |
| Schedule Variance | Actual Completion Date - Original Completion Date(in Days) | Performance (P): Core of the Schedule Slippage Index. |
| Cost Overrun Ratio | (Actual Cost - Approved Budget for Contract (ABC)/ ABC) x 100 | Integrity (I): Flags financial integrity risk. |
| Network Concentration | Count of Projects with Inter-Related Contractors/Total Projects | Network (N): The basis for the BO & Collusion Index. |

<br>

2. Systemic Risk Qualification <br> 
The second phase applied descriptive statistics, correlation testing, anomaly detection, and top-group clustering to identify patterns indicative of systemic failure. The procedures included: <br>
  a. Testing relationships across age, condition, delay, and cost metrics. <br>
  b. Detecting statistical outliers in quality, timeliness, and financial performance. <br>
  c. Grouping contractors by frequency and severity of performance deviations. <br>
  d. Assessing concentration levels within contractor networks and local political environments. <br>

3. Cross-Domain Integrity Mapping <br>
The third phase connected procurement outcomes with network and political concentration indicators. Beneficial ownership linkages, inter-related contractor patterns, and electoral dynamics were cross-referenced using proportional and concentration-ratio techniques. This step provided a consolidated view of vulnerability to collusion, repeat offending, and opaque contracting relationships.

#### *Data Treatment and Validation*

Quality checks included standard missing-value treatments, consistency verification across merged datasets, and sensitivity testing on derived metrics. Detailed formulations, classification rules, and statistical outputs are contained in the appendices.

#### *Purposes of the Methodological Appraoch*

This methodology was designed to produce an objective, evidence-driven foundation for evaluating procurement system performance and determining the operational design of the NCRS. It enabled a shift from descriptive reporting toward quantifiable, replicable indicators of quality, accountability, and transparency risks.

## **Insights and Analyses**

1. Systemic Infrastructure Vulnerabilities <br>
Analysis shows that infrastructure deterioration is not linked solely to asset age, indicating that structural weaknesses stem from procurement and construction processes. Even recently built projects exhibit vulnerabilities, with some classified as poor or bad. Geographic clustering—such as in Pangasinan—suggests that risks are localized, highlighting the need for region-specific interventions to strengthen infrastructure resilience.

2. Contractor Networks and Concentration Risk <br>
High-risk outcomes are disproportionately associated with contractors operating across multiple projects, indicating potential monopolistic practices and collusion. Beneficial ownership analysis reveals that some contractors maintain multiple related entities, allowing sanctioned or high-risk individuals to remain active in the market. Projects in politically dominated regions are often prioritized for visibility or financial gain rather than public need, amplifying systemic vulnerabilities and governance weaknesses.

3. Anti-Corruption and Governance Implications <br>
The NCRSS addresses corruption by linking contractor performance and blacklisting to beneficial ownership, penalizing opaque structures, and reducing repeated awards to high-risk entities. Network concentration analysis enables detection of related firms dominating bids, while standardized risk scoring (0–100) limits discretionary decision-making. The system creates a transparent audit trail, deterring political influence and favoritism while supporting evidence-based procurement decisions.

4. Climate and Socioeconomic Consequences <br>
Infrastructure failures, particularly in flood control, compromise disaster resilience and disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. Corruption reduces the nation’s capacity to respond to environmental risks, with politically dominated regions being especially susceptible to misaligned projects designed for personal or political gain.

5. Statistical Patterns and Cross-Domain Insights <br>
Quantitative analysis reveals that project failures, delays, and financial irregularities are concentrated among specific contractors and networks rather than randomly distributed. Interdependencies between contractor performance, integrity, and concentration amplify vulnerabilities. Political influence and opaque ownership further compound risks, highlighting the need for multidimensional monitoring across operational, structural, and governance domains.

6. Operational and Strategic Implications for NCRSS <br>
By integrating previously siloed datasets—CPES, PhilGEPS, blacklisting records, and COA audits—the NCRSS provides a centralized source of truth for procurement decisions. Automated risk scoring standardizes evaluations, reduces bias, and provides early warnings to prevent delays and cost overruns. Its public portal promotes social accountability, while multi-stakeholder governance ensures balanced oversight, industry engagement, and independent monitoring. Strategically, the system shifts procurement from reactive to preventive governance, enabling targeted interventions, reducing corruption risks, and improving fiscal efficiency.

7. Policy and Implementation Insights <br>
Evidence shows that infrastructure risk is systemic, concentrated among certain contractors and regions, and worsened by political influence and opaque ownership. Quantitative risk scoring and network analysis provide actionable tools for policymakers to identify high-risk contractors, prevent collusion, and enforce accountability. Linking operational performance with governance indicators allows for preventive, data-driven interventions, ensuring procurement aligns with public interest and strengthens transparency, ethical standards, and infrastructure resilience.
